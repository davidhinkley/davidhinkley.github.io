# Making Photo Gallery Accessible at davidhinkley.github.io/photo-gallery

## Current Status
- The photo-gallery project exists locally with a built React application in `/photo-gallery/client/build`
- The project is not yet accessible at https://davidhinkley.github.io/photo-gallery
- We need to set up the project similar to how TaskFlow is accessible at https://davidhinkley.github.io/to-do

## Analysis
- The main GitHub Pages repository is at `/home/david/Projects/davidhinkley.github.io`
- The TaskFlow app is deployed in the `/to-do` directory with its own index.html
- The photo-gallery app has a built version in `/photo-gallery/client/build`

## Plan
1. Create a `/photo-gallery` directory at the root level of the GitHub Pages repository
2. Copy the built files from `/photo-gallery/client/build` to the new `/photo-gallery` directory
3. Update asset paths in the index.html file to use the correct base URL (/photo-gallery/)
4. Commit and push the changes to GitHub

## Progress
- Analyzed the current repository structure
- Identified how the TaskFlow app is deployed
- Found the built version of the photo-gallery app
