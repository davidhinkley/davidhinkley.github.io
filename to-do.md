# Photo Gallery App Deployment to GitHub Pages

## Task: Prepare and deploy the photo-gallery app to GitHub Pages

### Analysis of Current State:
- The photo-gallery app is a full-stack application with:
  - React frontend (in the client directory)
  - Node.js backend (in the server directory)
  - GitHub Pages only supports static content, so we need to adapt the app

### App Structure Analysis:
- **Frontend (React)**:
  - Uses React Router for navigation
  - Has authentication features (login/register)
  - Fetches photos from backend API
  - Has features like photo upload, likes, and user management
  - Uses Tailwind CSS for styling
  - Has a proxy configuration pointing to localhost:5000

- **Backend (Node.js)**:
  - Provides API endpoints for photos, authentication, etc.
  - Stores data in a JSON database (db.json)
  - Handles file uploads and storage
  - Manages user authentication and authorization

### Deployment Challenges:
1. GitHub Pages only supports static content (no server-side code)
2. The app heavily relies on backend API for data and functionality
3. Authentication features won't work without a backend
4. Photo upload and management features won't work

### Deployment Strategy:
We have two options:
1. **Demo/Preview Mode**: Create a static version with mock data to showcase the UI
2. **Redirect to External Hosting**: Deploy the full app elsewhere and use GitHub Pages as a landing page

For this task, we'll proceed with option 1 - creating a static demo version.

### Steps for Deployment:
1. ✅ Modify the client to work with mock data instead of API calls
2. ✅ Build the React client for production
3. ✅ Configure React Router for GitHub Pages (using HashRouter)
4. ✅ Create a GitHub Pages-compatible structure
5. ✅ Test the static version locally
6. ⬜ Stage and commit changes
7. ⬜ Push to GitHub using SSH
8. ⬜ Verify the app is accessible at https://davidhinkley.github.io/photo-gallery/

### Progress:
- Analyzed the app structure and identified key components
- Created a mock data file with sample photos
- Modified the API utility to use mock data when in GitHub Pages environment
- Updated React Router to use HashRouter for GitHub Pages compatibility
- Created a landing page (index.html) for the photo-gallery directory
- Modified the PrivateRoute component to show informational messages in demo mode
- Updated .gitignore to allow the client build directory to be included in Git
- Added homepage field to client's package.json for proper path resolution
- Built the React client for production
- Tested the static version locally using npx serve

### Implementation Details:
1. **Mock Data**: Created a mockData.js file with sample photos, users, and categories
2. **API Interceptor**: Modified the API utility to intercept requests and return mock data when on GitHub Pages
3. **HashRouter**: Changed from BrowserRouter to HashRouter for GitHub Pages compatibility
4. **Demo Mode Indicator**: Added a banner to indicate when the app is running in demo mode
5. **Protected Routes**: Updated PrivateRoute to show informational messages instead of protected content
6. **.gitignore**: Modified to allow the client build directory to be included in Git
7. **Homepage**: Added homepage field to package.json to set the correct base URL

### Available npm Scripts:
```bash
# Main scripts
npm start             # Runs the full app (client + server)
npm run dev           # Same as start
npm run client        # Starts only the React client
npm run server        # Starts only the Node.js server

# Build-related
cd client && npm run build  # Builds the React client for production

# Installation
npm run install-all   # Installs dependencies for main app, client, and server
```

### Next Steps:
1. Stage and commit changes
2. Push to GitHub using SSH
3. Verify the app is accessible at https://davidhinkley.github.io/photo-gallery/

### Git Commands for Deployment:
```bash
# Navigate to the repository root
cd /home/david/Documents/Projects/davidhinkley.github.io

# Check status
git status

# Stage changes
git add photo-gallery/
git add to-do.md

# Commit changes
git commit -m "Prepare photo-gallery app for GitHub Pages deployment"

# Push to GitHub using SSH
git push origin main
```
