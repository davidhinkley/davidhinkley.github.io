# Photo Gallery GitHub Pages Troubleshooting

## Current Status
- ✅ Photo gallery has been configured for GitHub Pages
- ✅ React app has been built and files placed in the correct location
- ⬜ Changes need to be committed and pushed to GitHub
- ⬜ Testing on GitHub Pages pending

## Findings
1. ✅ The photo-gallery is a React application with a Node.js backend
2. ✅ Built the React app for deployment to GitHub Pages
3. ✅ Placed built files directly in the photo-gallery directory (no build subdirectory)
4. ✅ Updated the React Router to use HashRouter for GitHub Pages compatibility
5. ✅ Updated the API configuration to handle GitHub Pages deployment
6. ✅ Followed the same pattern as the successful to-do app deployment

## Completed Steps
1. ✅ Updated "homepage": "/photo-gallery/" in client's package.json (similar to to-do app)
2. ✅ Added a deploy script to package.json to simplify deployment
3. ✅ Changed BrowserRouter to HashRouter in App.js for GitHub Pages compatibility
4. ✅ Updated API configuration to handle GitHub Pages deployment
5. ✅ Built the React application using `npm run build` in the client directory
6. ✅ Used the deploy script to copy build files directly to the photo-gallery directory
7. ✅ Updated the index.html file in the photo-gallery directory with the built version

## Next Steps
1. ⬜ Commit all changes to the repository
2. ⬜ Push the changes to GitHub
3. ⬜ Test the deployment at https://davidhinkley.github.io/photo-gallery/

## Commands to Commit and Push
```bash
# Navigate to the repository root
cd /home/david/Documents/Projects/davidhinkley.github.io

# Add all changes
git add .

# Commit the changes
git commit -m "Add built files for GitHub Pages deployment"

# Push to GitHub
git push origin main
```

## GitHub Pages Deployment Notes
1. The React app is now configured to work with GitHub Pages
2. The homepage field in package.json has been set to "/photo-gallery/" (similar to to-do app)
3. HashRouter is used instead of BrowserRouter for proper routing on GitHub Pages
4. API calls are configured to detect GitHub Pages environment
5. Static files are now placed directly in the photo-gallery directory (not in a build subdirectory)
6. The structure exactly matches the successful to-do app deployment pattern
