# Git Troubleshooting Progress

## Current Status
- ✅ Successfully staged changes to `index.html` using `git add index.html`
- ❓ `git add .` was not working as expected initially

## Findings
1. ✅ Git configuration looks good - user.name and user.email are properly set
2. ✅ File permissions are correct (-rw-rw-r--)
3. ⚠️ Git was detecting `index.html` as a binary file
4. ⚠️ There's a syntax error in the HTML file (closing tag has `?` instead of `>`)
5. ✅ No .gitignore file exists that could be interfering

## Next Steps
1. Fix the HTML syntax error in index.html
2. Try `git add .` again to see if it works properly
3. Commit the changes
4. Push to GitHub repository

## Git Commands Used
```bash
git status                # Check repository status
git config --list         # View git configuration
ls -la index.html         # Check file permissions
git diff index.html       # View changes (showed binary file difference)
git add index.html        # Explicitly add the file
```
